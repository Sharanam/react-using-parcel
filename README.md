# React App with Parcel

This repository contains a React app bootstrapped using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), aimed at providing a basic editor with preconfigured styles on an A4 size paper. Originally conceived as a tool for writing monthly reports for batchmates during college, but the project is now abandoned.
